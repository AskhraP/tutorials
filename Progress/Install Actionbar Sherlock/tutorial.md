# Installation in Eclipse

Download the compressed Actionbar Sherlock from the Homepage http://actionbarsherlock.com/

Extract the project's contents 

Move the contents to a place on your machine that you'll use as the reference for Eclipse to include in its workplace.

Open Eclipse

File -> New -> Other... -> Android Project from Existing Code

Rooter Directory = The JakeWharton - ActionBarSherlock folder you extracted and moved earlier

Deselect all except the actionbarsherlock project

You can copy projects into the workplace if you so choose.

You'll then see the "actionbarsherlock" project in your list of projects in Eclipse

# Add Library to your Existing Android Project

Now that we have the actionbarsherlock library in Eclipse, we'll add it as a library to your existing Android project.

To do this, Right click on the project you wish to add the library to.

Click "Properties" and navigate to the "Library" section. Click "Add..." then select "actionbarsherlock" as the library you wish to include in your project. Click "Ok"

You should now see actionbarsherlock listed as one of your Project's Libraries with a green check mark next to it.

Click Apply then Ok.

You now have successfully added Actionbar Sherlock to your Existing Android Project. You can now implement its support library to make your app that much better!
